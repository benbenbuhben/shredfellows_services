[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/shredfellows/services.svg?branch=staging-branch)](https://travis-ci.com/shredfellows/services)

Shred Fellows is a  living instructional platform that can be integrated into any course, providing students a means of practice, self-study, and consistent curriculum delivery for short topics. Additionally, this could power a “Try Us Out” system where potential students could interact with an experience the uniquely Code Fellows methods of instruction.

## Routes

<a id="mongo"></a>
### Server Endpoints - *MongoDB/MLab*

#### ***Status*** - *Most of these routes are scaffolded out, but not yet fully integrated with mongoose commands.*


**GET** `api/v1/:model`

***Usage:*** `api/v1/assignments` could be used to show all past assignments  for all students (maybe protected route for instructional staff). 
(Question: What else could this be used for?)
___

**GET** `/api/v1/:model/:id/`

***Usage:*** `/api/v1/:model/:id` would be used to retrieve a single past assignment already submitted by a user (for study or revision). **Note:** *In this case, the `:id` is the assignment name. `:id` is a generic parameter, but doesn't need to be a number.* 

(Question: is it necessary to have `:studentId` as a route parameter as well. I think you'd get this for free from the auth middleware as req.user)
___

**POST** `/api/v1/:model`

***Usage:*** `/api/v1/:model` would be used to save/submit an assignment. It would be stored in the database for the authenticated user.
___

**PUT** `/api/v1/:model/:id`
***Usage:*** `/api/v1/:model/:id` would be used to edit an already submitted assignment.

___
<a id="github"></a>
### Server Endpoints - *GitHub API*

#### *Need to get with Ovi to see how these should look. Something like...*
**GET** `/api/v1/github/:assignments`
Gets all assignments (for public use).
(Question: Should this github related endpoints go in a separate js file/folder? )
___

**GET** `/api/v1/github/:assignments/:assignmentName`
Gets one assignments (for public use).
(Question: Should this github related endpoints go in a separate js file/folder? )

 ## User Stories 
 > ***1. As a user, I want a link on each Canvas assignment that re-directs me to the corresponding ShredFellows page.***

 - This link needs to pass to ShredFellows the course & assignment IDs.

> ***2. As a user, I want to be able to easily login through the Canvas OAuth utility.***

 - When the link is clicked from the Canvas assignment, it will first go through the OAuth workflow to authenticate/authorize the user. 
 - [Relevant OAuth documentation from Canvas](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.oauth.html)

> ***3. As a user, once finished with the assignment, I want to be able to submit it back to Canvas with one click of a button.***

- This will be accomplished with a simple ajax post back to the canvas API. For example,
> ### POST /api/v1/courses/:course_id/assignments/:assignment_id/submissions

 - Submission body will be taken from REPL form field (or alternatively, as a URL for that ShredFellows page, which would require some kind of admin priviliges to view all students' pages). 
 - More info on post body and parameters can be found [here](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/submissions.html).
